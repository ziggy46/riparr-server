"""
The four things the System pages report on: events, scheduled tasks, log files, backups.

These exist because an appliance with no screen has to be able to answer "what has this
thing been doing?" from the web interface alone. The *arrs settled this shape years ago
and it is worth copying wholesale (see DECISIONS.md D12): a rolling event log, a table
of recurring tasks with last/next execution, downloadable log files, and dated backups.

Two appliance-specific constraints shape everything here:

  * **The SD card is the enemy.** Every write is a write to flash that will eventually
    wear out, so the log files are small and few, the event table is capped and trimmed
    on a schedule, and nothing polls tightly.
  * **Power gets pulled.** The scheduler keeps its state in SQLite (WAL, D4) rather than
    in memory, so "last execution" survives a yank and tasks do not all stampede at once
    on the next boot.
