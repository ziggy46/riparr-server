"""Cover art for the disc in the tray, when we are sure enough to show it.

Why this exists: the box knows the disc's volume label and nothing else. Putting the
matching poster faintly behind the page is the difference between "a disc is present"
and "I know what you just put in" -- the same trick Plex uses, and it costs nothing.

Three decisions worth keeping:

**TMDb when there's a key, Wikipedia when there isn't.** TMDb has better artwork, but it
needs an API key, which means nobody gets a poster until they've registered for one.
With a key (see tmdb.py) its poster is used, under the same no-guessing rule; without
one, or when TMDb isn't sure, Wikipedia is asked as before. Wikipedia's search API needs no key, is a single
well-known endpoint, and hands back a canonical article title -- which is what makes the
confidence check below possible at all. `pilicense=any` is required: film posters are
non-free, so the default free-only filter returns nothing.

**A wrong poster is much worse than no poster.** "The Boss Baby" and "The Boss Baby:
Family Business" are one search apart, and showing the sequel's art behind the original
is the kind of detail that makes a product feel careless. So the normalised article
title has to match the normalised disc label to THRESHOLD, and anything short of that
shows nothing at all. Silence is a perfectly good answer here.

**The image is proxied, never linked.** Handing the browser a remote URL would leak the
viewer's address to Wikimedia and tell them what film is being ripped. Fetching it on
the box costs one request and keeps the page self-contained. The client never gets to
name the URL -- it gets an opaque token for a URL *we* resolved -- because an endpoint
that fetches whatever a caller asks for is an open proxy sitting inside the LAN.
