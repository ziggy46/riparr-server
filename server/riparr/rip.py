"""
The rip engine: disc in the tray to verified file on the share.

One worker thread per drive, each ripping its own disc. State lives in
SQLite and every transition is written before it is acted on, so pulling the cable
mid-rip -- the expected operating condition (D4) -- leaves a job that can be read on
the next boot and honestly resolved rather than a process that vanished.

## What is and is not implemented

**Implemented:** identification and fingerprinting, duplicate refusal, preflight and
mode selection (D10/D11), driving `makemkvcon` in robot mode with real progress,
whole-file transfer with progress, read-back verification (D6), the retain-until-
pressure purge policy, and resume-or-fail of an interrupted job on boot.

**Not implemented: D11's byte-level follow-copy.** The uploader does not chase the
file as MakeMKV writes it, because two things have to be true first and neither is
established yet:

  1. **R8** -- whether MakeMKV writes an MKV linearly or seeks back at the end to
     finalise headers and Cues. If it rewrites, follow-copy is dead by construction.
  2. A transport that can write at an offset. `smbclient` cannot append, and taking a
     dependency that can costs a native build on this hardware (see the note in
     `shares.py`).

Until then a rip is transferred when it is complete, which makes burst and stream
differ only in when the tray opens. Preflight therefore still *refuses* a disc that
does not fit, which is D10 as originally written -- the refusal D11 was meant to
retire. `Transport.supports_follow_copy` is the seam; when it goes True, only
`_plan_transfer` below needs to change.
