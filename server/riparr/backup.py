"""
Full-disc backup: the disc's own folder, menus and all, decrypted.

An MKV is the film. A backup is the *disc* -- `VIDEO_TS` for a DVD, `BDMV` for a
Blu-ray -- with its menus, extras, angles and every playlist, decrypted so it plays from
the folder and can be turned into an ISO later without the drive. It is what people ask
for when they want to keep the thing they bought rather than the part of it they watch.

## Two tools, because MakeMKV only does half of it

`makemkvcon backup --decrypt` handles Blu-ray and 4K UHD. **It does not do DVDs, and
never has**: the Backup button is not offered for one, in the GUI or on the command
line. GuinpinSoft's position is that a DVD is already backed up by copying it, which is
true of an encrypted ISO and not of a folder that plays.

So DVDs go through `dvdbackup -M`, which mirrors the whole disc through libdvdread --
and libdvdread decrypts CSS only if libdvdcss is installed. Neither ships on the box by
default, and libdvdcss is not in Debian at all. `packaging/dvdtools-install.sh` puts
them there, through the same one-way root door MakeMKV's installer uses; this module
reports whether that has happened and asks for it if not.

## What is promised and what is not

This module drives the tools and measures what they wrote. It does not decide where the
folder goes or whether it is safe to put it there -- that is the pipeline's job
(`rip.py`), because it is the same set of rules a film file obeys: never write into
somebody's library half-finished, never overwrite another disc's copy, prove it arrived.
