"""
What the drive is, and what is in it -- asked of the hardware directly.

`optical_drives()` in `platform.py` used to report `present: False` and `media: None`
unconditionally on real hardware, because nothing ever filled them in. Only the mock
branch said a disc was loaded. Every consumer keys off `present` -- the disc watcher,
`enqueue()`, the re-rip endpoint, the "Rip this disc" button -- so on the actual
appliance there was no path to start a rip at all. This module is what makes those
fields true.

## Three questions, three different answers

**Is there a disc?** One ioctl. `CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS` is answered by the kernel's own
cdrom layer from state it already tracks, costs nothing, and does not spin the disc --
which matters because the watcher asks it every three seconds forever.

**What kind of disc, and what can this drive read?** SCSI MMC `GET CONFIGURATION`
(46h), sent through `SG_IO`. The drive reports a *current profile* (what is loaded)
and a *profile list* (everything it can do). This is the same call `sg_get_config`
makes; it is inlined here rather than taken as a dependency because sg3-utils is not
on the image and one 10-byte CDB is not worth an apt package.

**Is this a 4K UHD drive?** Not answerable here, and pretending otherwise is the
expensive mistake this whole module exists to prevent. **There is no MMC profile for
UHD Blu-ray.** A UHD disc reports `BD-ROM` (0x40) exactly like a 1080p Blu-ray, and a
drive that will never decrypt one advertises `BD-ROM` in its profile list exactly like
one that will. The difference is AACS 2.0 and drive firmware, and the only software
that knows is MakeMKV. See `drives.py`.

## Everything here fails soft

A drive that does not answer a SCSI command, a kernel without the cdrom module, a
device node that vanished when someone pulled USB mid-poll -- all of them return "I do
not know" rather than raising. The rest of the app degrades to what it did before this
module existed, which was still a running appliance.
