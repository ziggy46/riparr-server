"""Television discs: is this a season disc, and which title is which episode.

A film disc asks one question -- *which title is the film* -- and `rip.choose_title`
answers it with longest-wins. A season disc asks a harder one, because every candidate
is the same length as every other candidate and the runtime tells you nothing. Six
titles of forty-two minutes is not an ambiguity to be resolved, it is six episodes, and
the job is to put them in the right order and give them the right numbers.

Four things on a real disc break the naive version of this, and all four are on the
MakeMKV forums with people working around them by hand:

**Title order is not episode order.** MakeMKV renumbers titles during its analysis pass,
so title 0 is routinely episode 4. Sorting by index produces a season in scrambled
order, which is the single most common complaint about ripping box sets.

**There is usually a "play all" title.** It is every episode end to end, so it is the
longest title on the disc and longest-wins picks it every time -- which is how a season
disc silently becomes one four-hour file. It has to be found and excluded. It is also,
happily, the best thing on the disc: see `_order_by_segments`.

**Episodes appear twice.** Discs are commonly authored with two playlists per episode --
one with the "next time on" trailer and recap, one without, for the play-all path. Six
episodes therefore present as twelve titles, and ripping all of them gives you every
episode twice at slightly different lengths.

**The disc's order is not the broadcast order.** This one cannot be solved here at all,
only respected. Firefly is the standard example: the disc opens with "Serenity", TVmaze
and TVDB both number "The Train Job" as S01E01 because that is what aired first. So
this module takes the *sequence* from the disc and only the *names* from the metadata,
and never lets the metadata reorder anything. Where they disagree, the disc wins and the
user gets one control to shift the mapping. See `build_plan`.

The ordering itself comes from the disc, in descending order of how much it can be
trusted -- `segments`, then `source`, then `index`. Each is a real technique people use
by hand; `ORDER_TRUST` records which one answered so the interface can say how sure it
is rather than presenting a guess as a fact.

Metadata is TVmaze, for the same reason `artwork.py` uses Wikipedia rather than TMDB:
no API key. A box that needs its owner to register for a developer account before it can
name an episode is a box that does not work out of the box. TVmaze is CC BY-SA and asks
to be credited, which the interface does.

    Two titles are the same episode when their segment maps overlap at all: an episode's

    playlists are two wrappers around that same footage. Overlap rather than equality,
    because the wrappers differ by exactly the segments that make them different.

    The longer one is kept because it is the complete broadcast episode -- recap, titles
    and trailer included. That is a judgement call and it is the one a person makes by
    hand for the same reason: the shorter cut exists to make the play-all flow smoothly,
    not to be watched on its own.

    Where there is no segment map, two titles built from the *same source file* are the
    same content, which is the same argument one level coarser and is what a DVD gives
    you when it gives you nothing else.

    Where there is neither, **nothing is merged.** Runtime and size were the obvious
    third fallback and they are not usable: two playlists of one episode differ by the
    twenty seconds of trailer between them, and two different episodes of one series
    differ by about the same amount. There is no threshold that separates those, so a
    runtime-based merge is a coin toss on every disc that reaches it -- and the two ways
    it can land are not equally bad. Ripping an episode twice is visible in the plan
    before it runs and costs one unticked box. Merging two distinct episodes deletes one
    of them from the season silently, and the user finds out much later, with the disc
    back in its box. So this errs towards duplicates, and `plan_warnings` says it did.
