"""Full-disc backup, end to end, through the real pipeline.

A backup is the first job whose output is a *folder* -- a few hundred files in nested
directories -- and the pipeline was built around one job producing one file. Seasons
taught that lesson once (see tv-pipeline.test.py); this runs every stage a backup goes
through against the mock drive and the mock share, so the places that still assume a
single file show up here rather than on somebody's NAS:

  * identify takes no title and scans nothing, but still names the disc
  * the rip writes VIDEO_TS or BDMV, and nothing else, into the library folder
  * staged backups are sent a file at a time; direct ones are one rename
  * a folder that already holds anything is never written into -- unless it is this
    same disc's earlier backup, which Re-rip replaces
  * verification checks every file, and fails when one is wrong
  * the purge only frees a staged backup the share can prove it has
  * a resumed send (after a power cut) sends a folder, not a directory entry
  * a DVD on a box without the DVD tools is ripped as a film, and says so
  * a disc ripped to an MKV is not a "duplicate" when it comes back for a backup

Nothing is stubbed except the hardware, as everywhere else in this repository.

Run: python3 server/backup-pipeline.test.py
