"""A whole season disc, end to end, through the real pipeline.

`tv-detect.test.py` proves the reasoning. This proves the plumbing: that a season disc
identified as one job produces *many* files, in the right folders, with the right names,
and that the film path did not change shape on the way past.

It runs the actual `_identify`, `_rip_season` and `_transfer_season` against the mock
drive and the mock share, with a throwaway database. Nothing here is stubbed except the
hardware, which is the same thing every other mock in this repository means.

Worth knowing what this catches that unit tests could not: the pipeline was written for
one job to produce one file, and that assumption is spread across five stages and a
dozen job columns. Ripping a season with it is the only way to find the places that
still believe it -- `local_path` holding a directory, `bytes_total` meaning the sum of
six things, staging cleanup running after the first episode and deleting the other five.
That last one was real, and `direct_mode_keeps_the_rest_of_the_season` is why.

Run: python3 server/tv-pipeline.test.py
